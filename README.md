# Memory Game

This is a simple number-based memory game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The game allows users to select the grid size (4x4, 6x6, or 8x8) and test their memory by matching pairs of numbers.

## Features
- **Selectable Grid Sizes**: Players can choose between 4x4, 6x6, or 8x8 grids for different levels of difficulty.
- **Reset Game Option**: Players can reset the game at any time and start with a fresh grid.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The game interface is simple, featuring a clean design using Tkinter widgets.
- **Randomized Number Pairs**: Each time the game is reset, the numbers on the grid are reshuffled.

## How to Play
1. Run the application.
2. Choose the grid size from the main menu.
3. Click on two tiles to reveal their numbers.
4. If the numbers match, the tiles remain revealed. If not, they will be hidden again.
5. Try to match all the pairs with as few moves as possible!
